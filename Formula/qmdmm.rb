# QMdmm's Homebrew formula. This is the one authoritative copy: the packaging
# harness (QMdmmPackagingCi) taps this repository rather than carrying a second
# copy, so what a user installs and what the harness verifies is the same
# recipe.
#
# There is no bottle block here. `brew bottle --merge --write` adds one, and
# the harness adds it to its own working copy inside the tap directory - never
# to this file, because a bottle records one exact build on one exact macOS
# version and this repository should only learn about one when a release is
# cut. A user installing today therefore builds from source, which is what the
# urls below describe.
#
# When the harness packages a ref that is not a tag - which is what the daily
# run does, since it packages `main` - it rewrites `url`, `sha256` and
# `version` in that working copy. A branch or a commit has no tag tarball, so
# the url becomes .../archive/<full-sha>.tar.gz and the version, normally
# detected from the url, has to be read out of the source tree and stated
# instead. The values committed here pin the tag that was verified locally: tag
# 0.0.1, whose tarball hashes to the sha256 below (measured three times, once
# through codeload directly).
#
# `QMDMM_MACOS_APP_BUNDLE=OFF` is the switch that makes this the shape a bottle
# can be built from. Left at its default on APPLE, the install produces a
# self-contained `QMdmm6.app` with Qt's frameworks, plugins and QML modules
# copied inside it - that is the `.dmg`'s shape, and it cannot be bottled
# because a bottle relocates a prefix rather than an application bundle.
# Turned off, the three programs land in `bin/` as siblings with Qt provided by
# the machine. Measured locally: OFF against Homebrew's Qt gives all three
# programs an LC_RPATH that resolves Qt out of the Homebrew prefix plus the
# install prefix's own `lib`, and all three start.
#
# The Qt dependencies are the three sub-modules QMdmm links against, and not
# `qt`. That meta formula exists to install every Qt sub-module Homebrew ships -
# 39 of them, including qtwebengine, which is 111 MiB of bottle on its own - and
# a QMdmm install has no use for the other 36. The three are what a walk of
# `otool -L` from all three programs to a fixed point reaches, against
# Homebrew's Qt 6.11.2: qtbase (Core, Network, Gui, Widgets), qtdeclarative
# (Qml, Quick, QuickWidgets) and qtwebsockets (QMdmmNetworking). `qtsvg` arrives
# with qtdeclarative; CMake's own package files for all of them are found in the
# Homebrew prefix, where linking the kegs puts them, so the build needs no
# prefix path of its own.
#
# `qttools` is a build dependency: QMdmmGui's CMakeLists.txt asks for
# LinguistTools, and `qt6_add_translations` runs lupdate and lrelease while
# building. Other modules can be added the day something links them, which is
# what makes this list a reading rather than a guess.
#
# None of this pins a Qt version - Homebrew keeps one version of each formula -
# so the Qt 6.7 floor the project declares cannot be expressed here and the
# bottle floats with whatever the tap's Qt currently is.
